                <p class="dt">Arvada, CO - January, 2010</p>
                <p>For the sixth year in a row, Ducts Unlimited Mechanical Systems, Inc. received the prestigious Metal of Honor award from Hercules Industries.  Rob Leishman, President, attributes the continued growth in sales for the company's ability to maintain the purchasing necessary to receive this award. Congratulations, Ducts Unlimited, for your continued success.</p>

                <p class="dt">Arvada, CO - August, 2009</p>
                <p>Early this month, Ducts Unlimited was notified that they earned the position of 1973 on the 2009 Inc. 5000, Inc Magazine's annual ranking of the fastest-growing private companies in America.</p>
                <p>The letter from Inc. Magazine informing Rob Leishman, President of Ducts Unlimited, states "...the list has served as evidence of the significant accomplishments of entrepreneurial companies. As an Inc. 5000 honoree, Ducts Unlimited Mechanical Systems shares a prestigious pedigree with some of the most successful businesses in America."</p>
                <p>As in years past when bestowed with this honor, Rob gives credit to his family and employees. Without their hard work and dedication, none of this would be possible.</p>

                <p class="dt">Arvada, CO - May, 2009</p>
                <p>Ducts Unlimited acquired a new facility in January of 2009. The tenant finish was completed in April and is now up and running. Ducts has invested heavily in making the new facility as Green as possible. They have installed all new Carrier PV model roof top units. The Carrier PV units are the highest efficient and the only LEED certified units on the market. All of the existing forced air unit heaters have been removed and replaced with high efficiency radiant tube heaters for the fabrication shop. The exterior walls and roof have R-30 insulation to maximize the gas heat that is being used. All offices have motion detector light switches in order to minimize the use of lights. Finally, the plumbing is designed for low water consumption. With all of these features Ducts Unlimited hopes to operate in a more environmentally friendly way.</p>
                <p>The new facility will allow Ducts to take a step forward in their ability to serve their customers. "First of all we will be making the transition from printing blue prints for bid to estimating on screen" says Rob, owner of Ducts Unlimited. "We will only print the plans for the projects we are awarded and cut our paper consumption by 80%. Our second exciting change will be to make the transition from 4' ductwork to 5' ductwork. This step alone will allow us to produce more ductwork in less time and get the product to the field for installation sooner, helping us achieve the ultimate goal of completing the projects on time. We at Ducts Unlimited are committed to providing the highest quality product and service available."</p>
