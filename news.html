                <p class="dt">Arvada, CO - January, 2015</p>
                <p>For the eleventh year in a row, Ducts Unlimited Mechanical Systems, Inc. has been awarded the prestigious "Metal of Honor" from Hercules Industries.</p>
                <p>Rob Leishman, President, attributes the company's ability to maintain the necessary purchasing to its continued growth in sales.</p>
                <p>Congratulations, Ducts Unlimited, on your continued success.</p>

                <p class="dt">Arvada, CO - August, 2014</p>
                <p>Earlier this month, Ducts Unlimited was honored with a ranking (#4145) in Inc Magazine's annual listing of the fastest-growing private companies in America, <strong>2014 Inc. 5000</strong>.  Receiving this honor for the fourth time, Ducts was ranked as the 75th fastest growing company in Denver.</p>
                <p>The letter from Inc. Magazine states "...the list has served as evidence of the significant accomplishments of entrepreneurial companies. As an Inc. 5000 honoree, Ducts Unlimited Mechanical Systems shares a prestigious pedigree with some of the most successful businesses in America."</p>
                <p>As in years past, Rob Leishman, President, gives credit to his family and employees. Without their hard work and dedication, none of this would be possible.</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="dt">Arvada, CO - May, 2009</p>
                <p>As of January, 2000, Ducts Unlimited acquired a new facility which, as of April, is now up and running. Ducts has invested heavily in making the new facility as green as possible: all new highest-efficiency Carrier PV model roof top units have been installed, and are the only LEED-certified units on the market; all existing forced-air unit heaters have been removed and replaced with high efficiency radiant tube heaters; and, to maximize the gas heat that is created, R-30 insulation has been installed in the exterior walls and roof. Additionally, all offices have motion-detecting light sensors in order to minimize excess use of energy and the plumbing has been designed for low water consumption. With all of these features, Ducts Unlimited hopes to operate in a more environmentally-friendly way.</p>
                <p>The new facility will also allow Ducts to better serve their customers as well as the environment. "First of all, we will be making the transition from printing blue prints for bid to estimating on screen" says Rob Leishman, President. "We will only print the plans for the projects we are awarded and cut our paper consumption by 80%. Our second exciting change will be to make the transition from 4' ductwork to 5' ductwork. This step alone will allow us to produce more ductwork in less time and get the product to the field for installation sooner, helping us achieve the ultimate goal of completing the projects on time. We at Ducts Unlimited are committed to providing the highest quality product and service available."</p>
