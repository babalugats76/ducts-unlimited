                <p>Gentlemen,</p>
                <p>I would like to take this time to let you know how your crews in the field did for us at the new Penske job that we just finished.</p>
                <p>Dan did an outstanding job of getting done when he said he would be done and had very few items on call back and punch list.  I look forward to working with Dan again on future jobs.</p>
                <p>Travis was a big help on getting the controls all worked out for the boilers and fans.  Good job Travis.</p>

                <p>I just want to send a note about the outstanding, remarkable work that Joe [and his co-worker] did on Saturday.  They came in to work on Saturday, banged out that project, and did a heck of a job.  They are great workers, very professional, and know what they're doing.  Ducts Unlimited is an extremely experienced and professional company.</p>
                <p>Thank you,</p>

                <p>I ran Vitol this week and your field guy and his helper were great to work with.</p>
                <p>They came ready to work, with a positive attitude every day. I asked for your inspection to take place on Friday and today the job was finaled out.</p>
                <p>Robert is self-sufficient on the job and gave me updates on his progress via phone calls.  This is relatively unheard of with field guys for all trades.</p>
                <p>I would like to have Robert on more MAX jobs!!!!</p>

                <p>Oso was the installer and foreman on our tenant finish project, Triangle Petroleum.  I just wanted to take a minute to say how well Oso performed on the project from start to finish.  He was courteous, and dealt with issues in an effective and efficient manner.</p>

                <p>I am writing to express my appreciation of the team effort given by Ducts Unlimited regarding the Encana 13th Floor tenant improvement project.  Your office did great in meeting my needs and releasing material and work so that I could meet my aggressive schedule.  Your onsite team did a fantastic job coordinating with myself and the other trades and exceeding expectations regarding schedules.  The quality was top notch and their willingness to protect other work and materials was much appreciated.</p>
                <p>I look forward to working with Ducts Unlimited again in the near future.</p>

                <p>Matt is always welcome on any of my projects.</p>

Congratulations on have the best in class technicians.  They are a wonderful example of why Ducts Unlimited is the top-tier provider of mechanical systems HVAC expertise.

                <p>I wanted to thank you for your service department dropping what you were doing to assist Carol and myself on executing the inspection of the South Park Building. I know you were very busy and that I can always count on you guys coming through for me.  It is my understanding that Carol and her client are very pleased with your performance and asked me to pass it along to you.</p>

                <p>I wanted to say that I will be requesting Matt for all my jobs with Ducts. I had Matt and Steve for the majority of the time on the RBC project and was extremely happy with both of them. They both have a "can do attitude" and communicated great with each other and with me. They look ahead to what is coming up and deliver what they communicate. Ducts is lucky to have guys like this in the company.</p>

                <p>Usually my emails are to ask for something or address a problem that the field can't solve. This email is to congratulate you on a job WELL DONE!</p>
                <p>Joe was my on-site foreman. He handled himself with professionalism and a genuine concern for our project. We always try to have the best people on our projects, but Joe stands out as a true tradesman. When we had a problem in the ceiling (which we always do) Joe made competent suggestions that the Mechanical Engineer agreed with. The Building Engineer and Manager even noticed Joe's quality of work and mentioned his professionalism to me as well.</p>
                <p>Just wanted to say thank you and great job!</p>
                <p>Best regards,</p>

                <p>Just a quick email about SNC. I wanted to say how great the install was at the SNC Hanger 13. Oso did a wonderful job with the trunk lines, the flex, sealing the ducts. It was straight, clean and looked great. He was very responsive to questions and always had an answer when asked.</p>
                <p>Thanks,</p>

We really think that Oso went above and beyond at the end of the project to help get the final HVAC with the building department. Thanks for your help!</p>

His dinner out with his family was interrupted by us at 6:30 Saturday evening and not only did he react immediately, but he did so with complete professionalism and courtesy. All I can say is OUTSTANDING and know that he represented your company in a manner of which you should be very proud.</p>

                <p>I wanted to let you know that both Fernando and Eric Garcia did an excellent job on the Suite 2540 project. We planned on having our inspection on Friday 2/17/2012 and due to the City of Denver having a furlough day we were forced to move up our inspection date. Eric and his helper were still able to make the earlier inspection and Fernando was able to provide additional man power to ensure that we passed our inspections. Ducts did a great job and the property management is extremely pleased as well. I look forward to working on future projects with Ducts Unlimited.</p>

                <p>I do not believe that any firm working on the AIA Colorado project profited monetarily, (At least not those who volunteered their resources). However, recognition of a job well done is warranted where applicable, and I belive it is applicable on this project.</p>
                <p>Until now, I personally was not aware of your Ducts Unlimited existence. However, from here on out I will keep in mind as one to recommend should the opportunity present itself.</p>

                <p>Dear Rob,</p>
                <p>In a recent job close out meeting we were told by Greg Gruno, our Superintendent, that your company and on-site crew preformed their job above and beyond expectations.</p>
                <p>As you may or may not be aware, about 90% of our projects come through repeat clients and referrals. The only way we can maintain this ratio is by consistently delivering a superior product for each of our clients. You continue to be a valuable part of our team and your contributions allow Mendel & Company to pursue our goal of "Building Relationships."</p>
                <p>We would like to take this opportunity to say "Thank You" and let you know how much your company's work ethic and dedication are appreciated.</p>

                <p>I wanted to take a minute to advise you of the work efforts and hard work that Ducts Unlimited did for me on the WSMT project. Your lead guy Eric, was awesome at always checking with me from day to day on my needs and path of their install. As you know the Modulines came in on many different shipments. Once we had a lot here Fernando Gomez made sure he put more men on the project for Eric. They were able to do the install of the Modulines and all the piping along with the controls that has allowed me to knock off a week from our schedule.</p>
                <p>It is very clear we have Ducts Unlimited as a Team Player on our projects. Please Pass this on to Estimating and to all the other office managers.</p>
                <p>Congrats to Eric and Fernando and their field team for making this happen.</p>

We have not missed a beat and you have been on top of every concern/change order. The 4th floor has been especially difficult because of the starts and stops, but again you have accommodated Max Construction and LBA Realty. Also I appreciate having Arturo as a foreman. He has always been polite, he is thorough, and he makes sure that his job sites are clean every night. Ducts Unlimited is the cleanest contractor that I have right now and I can not remember the last time I had to ask them to clean up after themselves.</p>
                <p>Thanks and I look forward to working with your team in the future.</p>

                <p>We enjoy our working relationship with your firm as well.  At the moment bidding is a very tough venture.  I know we are asking for big sacrifices on the jobs we go after.  Rest assured your willingness to support our efforts does not go unnoticed.   In good times we let the bids fall as they fall without pushing our base of subcontractors to the extent that is required by such a tough economy.  We appreciate your willingness to do all that you can in an effort that we may all stay gainfully employed.</p>
                <p>Thanks again for all the good times, friendships and your business professionalism.  I am sure we will all work together for many years to come.</p>

                <p>Rick displays a genuine desire to get the project completed with quality and efficiency. He shows that he cares about the way that his crew handles themselves while on site. I have been privileged to have a competent person such as him on my project, and look forward to working with him on future build-outs.</p>
                <p>Ryan Nieto continues to do an exceptional job for me from the administrative end. Which has been proven over the last 1.5 years of service at Lockheed.</p>
                <p>In general I have been impressed by the way that Ducts Unlimited has been committed, and shown, the commitment to be a premiere HVAC company.</p>
                <p>Kudos to all involved at Lockheed Martin Corp.</p>
                <p>Thanks again,</p>
